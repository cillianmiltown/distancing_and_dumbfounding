H1: Rates of reason-giving/dumbfounding/nothing wrong will vary depending on construal level/temporal distancing.
H1a: Higher construal will lead to increased reason-giving
H1b: Lower construal will lead to increased dumbfounding
H1c: Lower construal will lead to increased selecting of nothing-wrong (Ledgerwood)
H2: Moral ratings of the behavior will be influenced by construal level. There are competing predictions for the direction of this relationship:
H2a: Higher construal will lead to stronger condemnation of the behaviors, and lower construals will lead to weaker condemnations (e.g., Eyal et al., 2008; Agerstrom & Bjorklund 2009)
H2b: Higher construal will lead to weaker condemnation, and lower construals will lead to stronger condemnations (e.g., Gong & Medin, 2012; se also Ledgerwood et al., 2010, susceptibility to influence/counter-arguments)
H3: Ambiguity/trade-off salience will interact with the effect of construal level on moral ratings (Amaral & Jiao, 2023).
H3a: In ambiguous (high trade-off salience) scenarios (Trolley, Heinz), lower construals will lead to stronger condemnation of the behavior, while in unambiguous (low trade-off salience) scenarios (Jennifer, Julie and Mark) higher construals will lead to stronger condemnation of the behavior.
H4 (exploratory): Reason-giving/dumbfounding will vary depending on trade-off salience/ambiguity
H4a: Reason-giving will be higher for ambiguous scenarios than for unambiguous scenarios. Ambiguous scenarios, contain trade-offs framed in utilitarian terms prompting participants to think of utilitarian reasons to justify their judgments, these utilitarian reasons may be robust to the counter-arguments, leading to higher rates of reason-giving. In contrast, unambiguous scenarios will be more likely be considered in deontological terms, which may not be as robust to the counter-arguments leading to lower rates of reason-giving. 
H5 (exploratory): Ambiguity/trade-off salience will interact with the effect of construal level on reason-giving: We propose three competing predictions
H5a: The predicted effect of construal level on reason-giving/dumbfounding will only be observed for unambiguous (low trade-off salience) scenarios, with no effect of construal level on ambiguous scenarios. Specifically, for unambiguous scenarios, higher construals will lead to increased reason-giving. For ambiguous scenarios, reason-giving will be higher overall, and unaffected by construal level.
H5b: The predicted effect of construal level on reason-giving/dumbfounding will only be observed for ambiguous (high trade-off salience) scenarios, with no effect of construal level on unambiguous scenarios. For ambiguous scenarios, higher construals will lead to increased reason-giving. For unambiguous scenarios, reason-giving will be lower overall and will be unaffected by construal level.
H5c: The predicted effect of construal level on reason-giving/dumbfounding will be observed for unambiguous scenarios, but will be reversed for ambiguous scenarios. Specifically, for unambiguous scenarios higher construals will lead to increased reason-giving. For ambiguous scenarios the lower construals will lead to greater attention to contextual factors (Alper, 2020), which may facilitate reason-giving compared to higher level construals.
H6 (exploratory): The content of the reasons provided by participants will vary depending on construal level
H6a: Higher construals will lead to reasons that are based on abstract (deontological) principles
H6b: Lower construals will lead to more concrete/contextual (utilitarian) factors being cited in reasons given
